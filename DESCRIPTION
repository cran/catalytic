Description: To improve estimation accuracy and stability in statistical modeling, catalytic prior distributions are employed, integrating observed data with synthetic data generated from a simpler model's predictive distribution. This approach enhances model robustness, stability, and flexibility in complex data scenarios. The catalytic prior distributions are introduced by 'Huang et al.' (2020, <doi:10.1073/pnas.1920913117>), Li and Huang (2023, <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2312.01411>).
